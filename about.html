			      	<p>Road to Glory Finalist 2013
					WKA Heavyweight Champion, with a solid amateur career set Collette up for turning professional and when he scored three knockout wins in his first three fights in the pro-ranks, people began to take notice. When he had scored 14 knockouts out of 17 wins, and remained undefeated while doing so, he got himself onto the GLORY radar.
					Collette was invited to take part in the inaugural Road to Glory USA tournament in February 2012. Entering with a perfect 17-0 record he was a favorite to win it, but in the end came runner-up to Dustin Jacoby. Collette missed out on the grand prize but his performance was impressive enough to earn him a GLORY call-up anyway.
					Now 19-1, he makes his full GLORY debut on June 22 at GLORY 9 NEW YORK. It is a goal he has been working towards ever since his mother told him to take up a martial art aged 14. A journey through Tae Kwon Do, Boxing and Muay Thai has brought him to the pinnacle of the kickboxing world. Collette wants to be the best, and now he has a chance to prove it.
